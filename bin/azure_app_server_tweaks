#   To generate the nationwide-spotcrime-dot-map, the mapserver VMs need 
#   much more than the 3.4 GB RAM that the cheap Azure VMs have.
#
#   Each spotcrime tile at zoom level 3 take about 1.5 GB of RAM;
#   and the app servers are configured to generate a few tiles in parallel.
#
#   Workaround that by adding 10GB of swap to those too.
