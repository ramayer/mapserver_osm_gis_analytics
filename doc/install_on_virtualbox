# create VirtualBox vm with 2GB RAM and 20GB disk space

# change VirtualBox setting "Network Settings -> Bridged"

# install Ubuntu 16.04 server using all defaults except:
    * username/password, of course
    * ssh server


# this would be a reasonable time to shut down the VM and use VirtualBox's "clone" feature.


# log into Ubuntu

# make note of your IP address
