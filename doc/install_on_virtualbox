# create VirtualBox vm with:

   * 2GB RAM and
   * 30GB disk space (10 GB is enough for a tiny neighborhood of a couple city blocks.  800GB is enough for the whole planet)
   * "Network Settings -> Bridged"

# download Ubuntu 16.04 server
  * http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server 

# install Ubuntu 16.04 server using all defaults except: 
    * username/password, of course
    * ssh server should be enabled

# [Optional] If you want a clone of a blank Ubuntu install, this would be a reasonable time to shut down the VM and use VirtualBox's "clone" feature.

# log into Ubuntu

# make note of your IP address

# at this point, you should be able to go to 'http://[ip address]/' and see maps in a small neighborhood near downtown oakland.  

# To see more map data try one of: 

  ~/mapserver_osm_gis_analytics/bin/load_spatial_data --load-osm-data=smaller
  [expect that to take a couple hours, and use at least 12GB of disk space]
  
  or 
  
  ~/mapserver_osm_gis_analytics/bin/load_spatial_data --load-osm-data=small
  [expect that to take overnight, and use at least [TBD] disk space]
  
  or
  
  ~/mapserver_osm_gis_analytics/bin/load_spatial_data --load-osm-data=planet
  [expect that to take a well over a week, use about 40GB of RAM while working, and temporarily use at about 800MB of disk space]
  [you don't want to run that on a small VM]

# after loading more map data,
