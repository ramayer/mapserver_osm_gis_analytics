# create VirtualBox vm with:

   * 2GB RAM and
   * 30GB disk space (20GB is not enough for the Coastlines polygons)
   * "Network Settings -> Bridged"

# install Ubuntu 16.04 server using all defaults except:
    * username/password, of course
    * ssh server

# this would be a reasonable time to shut down the VM and use VirtualBox's "clone" feature.

# log into Ubuntu
