# mapserver_osm_gis_analytics
A GIS analytics platform built on OSGeo MapServer, Postgres/PostGIS, OpenStreetMap and US Census/TIGER data



Features:

 * Perhaps the nicest 'mapserver' '.map' files for rendering OSM data.
 * Indexes and materialized views to make such rendering possible.
 * Incorporating non-OSM data (census tiger, etc) to enhance the maps.
 * Examples of derived layers from joining OSM data with data from other sources.
